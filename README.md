# Usage
0. It is highly recommended that you backup your settings before using EANM.
1. If the settings directory was not automatically detected, browse to it
using the Browse button.
2. Choose the source account or/and the source character and which accounts/users
settings should be overwritten.
3. Click on "Copy (Overwrite)" for the settings you want to overwrite.

If you only want to overwrite some of the users/characters, you can select
only those in the list. By default every user/character that is not the
source is overwritten.

Each character is displayed in the form "identifier - Char Name - Last connection date",
the users are displayed in the form "identifier - Last connection date". If they
are defined in a profile or for an another server than Tranquility, this
is displayed in front of the line.
